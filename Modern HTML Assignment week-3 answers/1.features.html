            <h2>Intro of audio and video: </h2>
            <p>Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Header and Footer:</h2>
            <p> With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a div tag. Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By using header and footer HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Placeholder Attribute:</h2>
            <p>The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field/text area.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Email attribute: </h2>
            <p>When the input type in the form set as email, then the browser gets the instruction from the code to write a valid format email. The input email id is automatically validated to check the format of the email id is correct or not.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Storage:</h2>
            <p> In the case of HTML, we can use the browser as the temporary storage whereas, in the case of HTML5, application cache, web SQL database, and web storage is used.</p>
