    <h2>Web Accessibility : </h2>
    <p>Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible.Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the button element (and not a div element). <br>
    Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud. <br>
    With the button example in mind: 
        <ol>
            <li>buttons have more suitable styling by default</li>
            <li>a screen reader identifies it as a button</li>
            <li>focusable</li>
            <li>clickable</li>
        </ol>
    A button is also accessible for people relying on keyboard-only navigation; it can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be tabbed between (using the tab key on the keyboard). <br>
    Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content. <br>
    Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article - Clearly defines its content.
